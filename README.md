For now, we use a virtual env not contained. It's simply in the root of the folder and ignored in gitignore.

1 - Setup your virtual env
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
2 - Activate your virtual env
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
2 - Install dependencies
```
# Dependencies are in the app folder
pip install --no-cache -r app/requirements.txt
```

# Done
